                If your hotel has a restaurant or provides room service, you can use texting to manage reservations and order requests. Unlike phone calls, you don’t have to worry about mishearing your guests’ order. 
                You’ll have a record of exactly what they asked for.
                Use SMS to cross-sell and upsell your guests. Make it as easy as possible for guests to book additional services. 
                Let them message your staff to make spa appointments, book tours, or request an airport transfer.
                Some guests go their entire stay with the “Do Not Disturb” hanger on their door. Others want more frequent service, extra towels, more pillows and later checkout. 
                Give guests the ability to text you for all of these requests.
                Texting isn’t just for 2-way customer service. You can also send mass texts. 
                Have customers opt-in to your marketing list to receive offers, discount codes, and exclusive links to book special deals.
                Many hotels and hospitality businesses are investing in building custom apps. However, this sort of investment is costly for hotels and requires customers to have to download the product, which not everyone is willing to do.
                The travel experts at Skift reported that most hotel apps aren’t worth downloading. Think of it this way: all phones are capable of sending and receiving text messages, and all of your guests have phones.
